<!--
 TODO Curate lists in words.js.

 In particular, words that indicate things about people that they were
 not clearly able to choose for themselves are usually not
 entertaining.

 Therefore, words that refer to the following things likely ought to
 be removed:
 * Places of origin
 * Languages
 * Religions/Religious sects
 * Political ideologies
      * These are often boring anyway
 * Sexualities and/or Genders
      * Non-specific references to the act of sex are fine
 * Human-specific physical appearance
      * Things like "large" are okay, but, (for example) things that
      are most often used for racialization are not.

 Me deciding that words should be removed from these lists of words
 does not mean that I think the things those words refer ought to be
 removed from the human experience. It merely means that I think that
 the awkward/offensive combinations those words make possible outweigh
 the combinations, (if there are any,) that work well.
